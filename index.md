## About Us
2nd Look Consulting was founded by Dr Mirna Lerotic in 2010. Her interest in scientific software design and implementation started during her PhD studies at Stony Brook University, New York where she had the opportunity to work at Scanning Transmitting X-ray Microscopy beamline at National Synchotron Light Source in Brookhaven National Laboratory. As a part of her research she developed a new method for spectromicroscopy data analysis which is now used by a number of research groups.

After receiving her PhD she accepted a position as a research associate at Imperial College in London. At Imperial College she created a new method for augmented reality with medical applications which displayed preoperative data artificially on the body, seamlessly and in situ. The method was implemented in combination with daVinci Surgical System medical robot and this work was published and patented.
